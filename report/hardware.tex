For hardware we have used the following. For Wireless Access Point we have decided to use 
relatively cheap Mikrotik RB951Ui-2HnD~\cite{mikrotik:rb951ui}. We have made 
such choice primarily because of the Mikrotik RouterOS~\cite{mikrotik:routeros}, 
which among many other features supports RADIUS authentication and accounting. Moreover, 
this Linux-based operating system has flexible settings for WPA-2 Enterprise, routing,
traffic shaping and many more. For the server side hardware we have used cheap Raspberry 
PI microcomputer which is powerful enough to support RADIUS, MySQL and web-based management 
tools. Of course, this is only good enough for prototyping and demos.
